# Datatype Implementations

***
This Repository is home to Datatype Implementations of common Data types in Java.
This Repository was created to not only extend my Obsidian Notes Vault with useful Implementations to aid me in learning for my finals in Comp Sci / Information Technology, but to also learn how to type them out quickly, even though I have to write it out with a pen anyway :p.
I figured if I already put that much effort into it, I might as well publish it on GitHub for anyone to use :). Feel free to use or modify my examples to aid your education needs, or even in your Development.

**DISCLAIMER**: Although those should be working examples, I hereby declare that if anything goes wrong, I shouldn't be held liable. Those Implementations are first foremost there for Education purposes, not for use in production code. I hereby also declare that I can't guarantee all the code being in working order.

Good Luck with whatever educational endeavor you are preoccupied with.
